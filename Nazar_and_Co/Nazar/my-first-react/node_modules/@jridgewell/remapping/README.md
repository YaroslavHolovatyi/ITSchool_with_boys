> Remap sequential sourcemaps through transformations to point at the original source code

Remapping allows you to take the sourcemaps generated through transforming your code and "remap"
them to the original source locations. Think "my minified code, transformed with babel and bundled
with webpack", all pointing to the correct location in your original source code.

With remapping, none of your source code transformations need to be aware of the input's sourcemap,
they only need to generate an output sourcemap. This greatly simplifies building custom
transformations (think a find-and-replace).

## Installation

```sh
npm install @jridgewell/remapping
```

## Usage

```typescript
function remapping(
  map: SourceMap | SourceMap[],
  loader: (file: string, ctx: LoaderContext) => (SourceMap | null | undefined),
  options?: { excludeContent: boolean, decodedMappings: boolean }
): SourceMap;

// LoaderContext gives the loader the importing sourcemap, tree depth, the ability to override the
// "source" location (where child sources are resolved relative to, or the location of original
// source), and the ability to override the "content" of an original source for inclusion in the
// output sourcemap.
type LoaderContext = {
 readonly importer: string;
 readonly depth: number;
 source: string;
 content: string | null | undefined;
}
```

`remapping` takes the final output sourcemap, and a `loader` function. For every source file pointer
in the sourcemap, the `loader` will be called with the re
